It is considered more appropriate to seek to design something which sits comfortably in its surroundings rather than to slavishly follow Planning Circular 3/91. Indeed, HP14 makes allowance for changes of size or siting where ""changes of siting or size would result in an overall environmental improvement"" and also uses the term ""generally"" in advising to follow policies 2-7 of Planning Circular 3/91 and also refers to exceptions where a more modern, innovative design is acceptable due to its high quality which would not result in an adverse visual impact.

No Assessment	"""It is clear, through the references to replacement dwellings requiring generally to be traditionally designed but also that they should be finished to match the existing, that there are conflicts within this policy and it would be impossible in this case to follow all of its recommendations. It would also be very difficult or impossible to create a replacement dwelling which did not have a greater visual impact than the existing where what is proposed was a visual improvement on the existing, due to the existing property having a low pitched roof, part of which leads to the description of the existing dwelling being of poor form. It must follow, therefore, that the replacement dwelling will almost certainly be more visible than the existing and this is particularly the case if improved standards of visibility for those drivers emerging from the site are to be provided, involving the lowering of vegetation and the widening of the access. As such, in judging whether there would be less visual impact from the proposed dwelling, it is important to bear in mind that the new house will be taller and more easily seen, even were it to be a single storey property."""

These policies deal with the design, proportion and massing of the proposed dwelling. The proposed replacement dwelling in terms of its proportion, design features and window fenestration is considered to have similarities to an extended two storey traditional Manx cottage.
6.3.6 Whilst the dwelling would not follow the form of a double cube with typical dimensions of 11 x 5.5 metres, the proposed dwelling is considered to respect a regular fenestration and maintains a central porch entrance. The larger proportioned dwelling results in a dwelling with five upper front windows as opposed to the typical symmetrical window fenestration of three upper front windows. However, as previously outlined, the proposed dwelling under this scheme is judged to represent a dwelling with traditional features and character, symbolising an extended version of a vernacular three upper front window dwelling.
6.3.7 Chimneys are a familiar feature of the Island and make a particular visual impact in the rural areas. Their provision in modern housing is justified both for functional reasons and for their visual contribution, most notably being on both gable ends of a dwelling. Policy 6 of Planning Circular 3/91 states that chimneys are considered important features and their provision following past patterns is recommended. The dwelling proposed within this planning application incorporates chimney stacks, one working and one dummy, at either gable end of the dwelling which is a welcome feature and adds to the traditional appearance and character of the proposed dwelling.
6.3.8 The windows of the dwelling would be white UPVC framed 50/50 split casements. Normally, the windows would be timber framed double hung in comparatively small openings with the window reveals usually deep. Planning Circular 3/91 states that normal double hung sash windows are an important element in the appearance and quality of the façades of dwellings and these original elements should be restored or installed in this case. Although the windows would not be sliding sash it is considered that they would have minimal impact upon the character and appearance of the property and locality in general. The installation of the casements proposed are considered acceptable as they have a 50/50 split which would be similar to the glazing sections of sliding sashes. The south west and rear, northwest, elevation are not traditional with regards to window fenestration or window and door type. However, the south west elevation would not be visible from a public thoroughfare and as such would have a minimal, if any, impact upon the character of the locality or dwelling as viewed from a public thoroughfare. With regards to the rear elevation, this elevation would not be overly prominent with the street scene with the ground floor screened from existing built development and planting.  6.3.9 With regards to the finishes of the proposed dwelling, firstly Planning Circular 3/91 states that natural slate is recommended as the normal roofing material for buildings in the countryside which this scheme accords with. In terms of the white rendered external finish, the walls of traditional dwellings in the countryside were sometimes left as stone but more often rough pointed and white washed. This white finish is very characteristic of the rural parts of the Island and should remain a standard requirement for new buildings in the countryside. The planning circular goes onto say that the external finish to walls should be either stone, white painted render, or occasionally natural stone chip faced render, which again this scheme accords with."

It cannot do this as GP3, EPs 15-22 include provision for different types of development which are considered acceptable under certain circumstances. The approach in previous applications is to focus upon the impact of the extension of the curtilage in terms of how this affects the character of the countryside and the setting and context of the dwelling. In some cases the extension of a curtilage can result in what is currently natural landscaping becoming manicured and managed and looking quite different to what surrounds it. In other cases extensions can lead to what are currently modest properties looking much grander and in a much more formal setting and in these cases, sometimes leading to proposals for alterations and extensions and sometimes redevelopments which can be difficult to resist as the context of the property has changed such that it can accommodate a much larger dwelling. In this case the dwelling will look very much like what already has approval, although it will have moved further into the plot. The relative relationship of the house with its garden will remain very similar to what has approval. At present the boundary is visually soft and inconspicuous and what is proposed will be the same as this.
